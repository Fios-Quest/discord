Discord Redirect
================

It seems like no matter what I do, Discord keeps changing the invite link for Fio's Quest.

Obviously, the ideal situation would be to have a perma link with Discord but this requires 14 boosts, which would be
nearly $500 a year.

So instead we'll do a redirect in one place, so I don't have to update my entire back catalogue every time it changes.

Usage:
------

There's a workflow file for replacing the template variables. Change the environment variables in GitHubs settings to
change the invite url.
